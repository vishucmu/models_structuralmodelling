{\bf\Large Task 1}
\begin{enumerate}[\bf\large 1.]
    \item {\bf\large Object model diagram}\\
    \includegraphics[width=6in]{nicebook.jpg}
    \item {\bf\large Ambiguities and alternatives}\\[1ex]
    Because of the ambiguities of English document, we made several assumptions to ensure our model can account to all possible situations.
    We have considered and rejected several alternative ways to design the system during our modeling process.
    Here, we will first list our assumptions and then talk about the alternatives we have rejected.
    \\[1ex]\textbf{Assumptions: }
    \begin{enumerate}[1)]
        \item A content that has already been uploaded cannot be uploaded again.
        \item A newly-uploaded content has no tag added to and no comment attached to.
        \item The privacy level of a note is the same as the privacy level of all photos it contains.
        \item The uploader of a note is the same as the uploader of all photos it contains.
        \item When a note is uploaded, all the photo(s) it contains is(are) also uploaded.
        \item A newly-uploaded comment cannot be attached to any content.
        \item A content can be removed by its uploader only.
        \item A photo which belongs to a note(some notes) cannot be removed, but it can be removed after the note(s) it belongs has(have) beed removed.
        \item When a content is removed, all the comments and tags associated with that content are removed as well.
        \item When a content is removed, it is unpublished from all the walls of the Nicebook.
        \item A content that has already been published on a user’s wall cannot be published again on the same wall.
        \item The publisher should have permission to view (or directly upload) the content before he/she publishs it.
        \item A user can only unpublish a content from his/her own wall.
        \item A comment always has a privacy level Everyone.
        \item A user must be able to view the content associated with the tag in order to tag other users regarding that content.
        \item A user cannot tag him/herself.
        \item A user cannot tag another user twice to a content. 
        \item The remove tag operation can only be performed by three types of users: the tagger, the user who got tagged, and the owner of the content.
    \end{enumerate}
    \textbf{Alternatives: }
    \begin{enumerate}[1)]
        \item We have considered creating the model without a signature of Nicebook, which means that we consider the entire model as the instance of Nicebook. However, this solution did not work out as we must have a signature of Nicebook to represent the pre-condition and post-condition in Nicebook.
        \item We have considered having a signature called “Wall” to represent each user’s wall. However, if we do this, it will be very hard for us to locate all the walls a specific content has been published on when we try to remove that content. Therefore, we choose to use a User to Content relation to represent the wall.
        \item We have considered representing tag with only a relation. It turned out that it is not enough as it is hard for us to represent the tagger, the taggee, and the content associated with the tag. Hence, we decide to add a “Tag” signature which contains a set of its tagger, a set of its taggee and a set of content associated with it. 
        \item We have considered that a note can contain photos uploaded by other users or with a different privacy level, but it will make the note incomplete when the note is published on some other user's wall.
        \item We have considered that a comment can have a different privacy level. However, sometimes it will make some comments invisible to some users although the users can view the content it is attached to.
        \item We have considered that a user can tag him/herself. However, this action is useless because if he/she hopes to publish the content onto his own wall, he/she can do it directly.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item {\bf\large Implicit assertions}
    \begin{enumerate}[1)]
        \item A content is added a tag to can be published to the taggee's wall only if the content is uploaded by the taggee or his/her friend. Becuase only the wall's owner or his/her friend's content can be published on the wall.
        \item A user can execute an oprtation in Nicebook only if he/she is a user of the Nicebook.
        \item All the contents which are publied on a wall are uploaded to the Nicebook.
        \item All the contents which are attached to by a comment are uploaded to the Nicebook.
        \item All the photos which are contained by a note which has been uploaded to the Nicebook are uploaded to the Nicebook.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item {\bf\large Invariant violation and fixing}\\[1ex]
    When we first check the operation “unpublish”, it violated one of our invariants, which is the content on a user’s wall must be uploaded by the user or his/her friends. The reason for this violation is that we have an imply relation inside predicate “unpublish” like this:
    \begin{alloy}
c in n.walls[u]and c not in Comment implies n'.walls = n.walls - (u -> c)
    \end{alloy}
    In this case, if the content “c” is not on the original wall or “c” is a comment, the entire expression will be true no matter whether we remove the “u->c” relationship or not. Therefore, there might be a situation that the original wall is empty and the wall after “unpublish” contains some contents. The violation is fixed by changing the imply relation to the and relation. Like the following:
    \begin{alloy}
c in n.walls[u]
c not in Comment
n'.walls = n.walls - (u -> c)        
    \end{alloy}
    In this case, the content “c” must be in the original wall and is guaranteed to be unpublished after the operation.
    \item {\bf\large Scopes}\\[1ex]
    We chose $for~12~but~exactly~2~Nicebook$ for all the assertions to check the operations and $runComment$. 
    And we chose $for~12~but~exactly~3~Nicebook$ for $runContent$, $runPublish$ and $runTag$.
    We chose $for~15~but~exactly~8~Nicebook$ for $runNicebook$.
    Because for all assertions, we need to check the pre and post condition of the Nicebook, and 2 Nicebooks are enough.
    For $runComment$, we need to prove that the operation is feasible and only one pre and one post conditions are enough.
    For $runContent$, $runPublish$ and $runTag$, we need to prove two operations are feasible so we need two pre and two post conditions. But we can use a post condition of one operaition as the pre condition of another operation.
    For $runNicebook$, we need to prove seven operations are feasible so we need seven pre and seven post conditions. But we can use six post conditions the pre condition of another six operations.
    For other signatures, we try to check as many as possible considering the computing ability of the computer, so we chose the number 12/15 here because with the increment of the scope, the cost of running increases geometrically.\\{}
\end{enumerate}
{\bf\Large Task 2}
\begin{enumerate}[\bf\large 1.]
    \item {\bf\large Function} \texttt{\large viewable}\\[1ex]
    The function is in the alloy file Privacy.sty.
    \item {\bf\large Assertion} \texttt{\large NoPrivacyViolation}\\[1ex]
    The assertion is in the alloy file Privacy.sty.
    \item \texttt{\large NoPrivacyViolation} {\bf\large Satisfication}\\[1ex]
    The violation exists when a content is published to the wall of a user other than the uploader of the content, all the users that follow the privacy level of the wall owner can view the content although they do not follow the privacy level of the content. For instance, according to the diagram, we find that for the Photo2, User2 can view it because it is published on User0’s wall and User0 set his/her privacy level for viewing is Everyone. However, under the privacy setting of Photo2, User2 cannot view it because he/she is neither friend of User1 or friend of a friend of User1.\\[1ex]
    \includegraphics[width=6in]{counterexample.png}\\[1ex]
    The solution we figured out is to take the intersection of the two privacy level. Specifically, a user can view a content only when the content’s owner’s privacy setting and the privacy level of the content itself both allow him/her to see the content. In this case, there won’t be situations that a user who satisfy the privacy setting of the content’s owner while not satisfy the privacy level of the content itself can view the content.\\
    To verify the modification, we changed the predicate contentOnWallCanView and no violation remains.
    \begin{alloy}
// Check whether user u can view content c
// directly on the wall of u'
pred contentOnWallCanView[n : Nicebook, u, u' : User, c : Content] {
    // content c should be on the wall of u'
    c in n.walls[u']
    // follow the privacy level of content c
    privacyFollow[u, c.uploadedBy, c.privacy]
    // if content is not uploaded by u', then follow
    // the view privacy level of u'
    u' != c.uploadedBy implies privacyFollow[u, u', u'.privacyView]
}
    \end{alloy}
