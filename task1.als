 * Set of all users using Nicebook

 * privacySettingView: Marks the set of users that can view them
 * privacySettingComment: Marks the set of users that can comment them
 *
 * Tips when writing predicates like "addComment"
 * 1. first check whether the content is published on the wall
 * 2. then check privacy level to see whether the viewer
 *    is in the smaller set. (Content PL & Owner PL)
 * 3. add comment by using pre/post conditions
 * 
 * PLEASE CHECK THE WHOLE WRITE-UP
 * Not everything is in the description of operations,
 * nor in this already done structure.
 *
 * For "addComment", for example:
 * "A user can add a comment only to a piece of content 
 * that it owns or is visible on another userâ€™s wall."
 * Please implement all checks
